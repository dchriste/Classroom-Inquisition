This repo is designed more for version control and aid in backing up 
my code in a logical manner than anything else. If you feel that I 
could add something, I would prefer more suggestions than your 
actually writing to help with the project (as it isn't finished, and
it is an individual project). Upon its completion I will most likely
GPL the software.

Thanks for checking out my project,

ps Be kind as I've taught myself half of what's here and know that it
probably isn't the proper way of going about things.
